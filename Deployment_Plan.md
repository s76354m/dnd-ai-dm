   - Event system for tracking game events
   - State management for game persistence

2. **Character System**
   - Character creation and management
   - Inventory system
   - Equipment handling
   - Basic character stats and abilities

3. **World System**
   - Location management
   - NPC interactions
   - Basic world state tracking (time, weather)

4. **Save/Load System**
   - Game state persistence
   - Save file management
   - Load game functionality
   - Save metadata tracking

## Recently Completed

1. **Save/Load System Integration**
   - Integrated save/load functionality with the game loop
   - Added commands for saving and loading games

   - Created test script to verify save/load functionality

2. **Combat Integration Test**
   - Created a comprehensive test script for combat integration
   - Implemented mock character, NPC, location, and game state creation
   - Fixed TypeScript interface compatibility issues
   - Ensured proper type validation for game objects

## In Progress
