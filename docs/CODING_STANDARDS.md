# Coding Standards

To maintain code quality across the project, follow these conventions:

- Use **TypeScript** for all source files.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` before submitting a pull request.
- Write descriptive comments for complex logic.
- Prefer consistent, readable code over clever one-liners.

Adhering to these standards helps keep the codebase maintainable for everyone.
