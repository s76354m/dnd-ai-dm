- Combat limited to basic options (attack, use item, cast spell)
- Limited pre-built campaign content

## Getting Started
Please refer to the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed installation and usage instructions. For a quick start:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run setup-ai-keys` to configure your AI provider
4. Run `npm run health-check` to verify your installation
5. Start playing with `npm start`

## First Run Tips and Tricks

### AI Key Setup
- When setting up your AI keys, store them securely using the encryption option
- OpenAI GPT-4 models provide the best results but GPT-3.5 can be used for faster responses
- Consider setting environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) for easier deployment

### Character Creation
- Take your time during character creation - your choices affect gameplay significantly
- The point-buy system allows for more optimized characters than rolling for stats
- Fighters and clerics are most beginner-friendly; wizards and druids have more complexity

### Combat Strategy
- Use the `look` command to get details about enemies before engaging
- Remember that positioning matters - use the `move` command strategically
- Use the `help combat` command during your first battle to see all available options

### Exploration
- Use the `examine` command on objects in your environment for hidden details
- The `talk` command with NPCs often reveals quest opportunities and valuable information
- Use the `inventory` command frequently to check your available items

### Troubleshooting
- If AI responses seem confusing, use the `clarify` command
- Use `save` frequently to avoid losing progress
- If you encounter any technical issues, run the health check with `npm run health-check`

## Example Use Cases

### Character Creation
```
npm start

> Welcome to D&D AI Dungeon Master!
> Let's create your character.
> What is your character's name? Tharion
> Select a race: Elf
> Select a class: Wizard
> ...
```

### Sample Combat
```
npm run combat-example

> You encounter a group of goblins in the forest clearing!
> Rolling initiative...
> The goblin scout eyes you warily, then suddenly nocks an arrow, the 
> crude fletching trembling slightly as it draws back its bowstring...
```

### Narrative Example
```
npm run narrative-example

> The ancient ruins of Khal'doreth rise before you, stone sentinels standing
> guard over forgotten secrets. Mist curls around crumbling columns, and the
> air feels heavy with untold history...
```

### Quest Example
```
npm run quest-example

> New quest created: "Rat Problem"
> Quest accepted: "Rat Problem"
> Player encounters rats in the cellar...
> ...
> Quest completed: "Rat Problem"
```

### Location Example
```
npm run location-example

> Generating tavern in Green Valley...
> Name: Green Valley Tavern
> Description: A peaceful tavern with bright lighting...
> NPCs: Innkeeper Jorgen, Traveling Bard...
```
