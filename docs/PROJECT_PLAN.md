# D&D AI Dungeon Master - Project Plan

## Project Overview

DnD-AI-DM is an advanced TypeScript application that leverages large language models (LLMs) and structured data systems to create a fully automated Dungeon Master for Dungeons & Dragons campaigns. This system provides a complete text-based D&D experience without requiring a human Dungeon Master, handling all aspects of gameplay including narrative generation, combat resolution, character management, and world simulation.
