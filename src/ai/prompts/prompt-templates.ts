      assistant: "As you carefully examine the study, roll an Investigation check for me.\n\n*Player rolls a 17*\n\nWith a 17, your thorough search pays off. Behind the large bookshelf, you notice faint scuff marks on the floor. Pushing on the side of the bookcase, it swings open with a soft click, revealing a narrow passage beyond. The hidden doorway appears to lead to a cramped staircase spiraling downward into darkness."

Roll your attack.\n\n*Player rolls a 15*\n\nA 15 hits! The goblin chief's crude leather armor isn't enough to stop your strike. Roll damage.\n\n*Player rolls 8 damage*\n\nYour sword cuts deep across the goblin's chest, drawing a howl of pain and rage. Blood seeps through its crude armor as it staggers back but remains standing. The wound looks severe (8 damage dealt) and the chief's eyes narrow with newfound respect and hatred for you. It's now the archer goblin's turn..."

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to the point you choose among the orcs and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame.\n\nEach creature in the 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point needs to make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC is 15 (your spell save DC).\n\n*DM rolls saving throws*\n\nTwo of the orcs dive behind their shields with surprising agility, while the other three are caught fully in the blast. Rolling damage now: 8d6...\n\n*DM rolls 8d6 = 27 fire damage*\n\nThe flames deal 27 fire damage to the three orcs who failed their saves, instantly incinerating the two smaller ones who collapse into charred heaps. The larger orc with the jagged scar remains standing but is badly burned. The two orcs who succeeded on their saves take 13 damage each, looking singed but still very much in the fight and now enraged at your display of power.\n\nIt's now the orc war chief's turn. He bellows in rage at the death of his underlings..."

      user: "Can I use my reaction to cast Shield since the goblin hit me?",
      assistant: "Yes, you can use your reaction to cast Shield, which will increase your AC by 5 until the start of your next turn.\n\nAs the goblin's crude dagger strikes toward you, you quickly weave your fingers in a protective gesture and speak a quick arcane word. A shimmering, invisible barrier of magical force appears around you, deflecting the attack that would have otherwise landed.\n\nWith the Shield spell increasing your AC from 15 to 20, the goblin's attack roll of 17 now misses. The dagger harmlessly glances off your magical protection, and the goblin snarls in frustration.\n\nYou've now used your reaction for this round. The goblin continues its turn, backing away slightly after its failed attack."

/**
 * Social interaction prompt template
 */
const socialPromptTemplate: PromptTemplate = {
  systemPrompt: `
${basePromptTemplate.systemPrompt}

You are facilitating a social interaction scene. Focus on:
- Role-playing NPCs with distinct personalities, motivations, and knowledge
- Responding to social skill checks appropriately (Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation, Insight)
- Providing realistic NPC reactions based on their relationships and dispositions
- Remembering information the player has shared or discovered about NPCs
- Maintaining consistency in NPC attitudes and knowledge

      assistant: "\"Working for the baron, you say?\" The guard narrows his eyes skeptically, his hand resting on his sword hilt. \"Funny, he didn't mention anyone investigating on his behalf.\"\n\nThis seems like a Persuasion check. Given the guard's suspicious nature and lack of prior notification, this won't be easy. Roll a Charisma (Persuasion) check.\n\n*Player rolls a 18*\n\nWith an 18, your confident delivery and the casual mention of specific details about the \"strange noises\" gives your story credibility. The guard's expression softens slightly.\n\n\"The baron does have a lot on his plate these days,\" he admits, relaxing his posture. \"And there have been odd sounds coming from that wing at night. None of us are eager to investigate it ourselves.\" He glances around, then lowers his voice. \"I shouldn't do this, but... go ahead through. Just be quick about it, and if anyone asks, I never saw you. And if you find anything dangerous in there, you come tell me first, understood?\"\n\nHe steps aside, allowing you passage into the restricted area."

      user: "I'd like to insight check if the merchant is being honest about the quality of this 'magical' sword.",
      assistant: "As the merchant extols the supposedly magical properties of the ornate sword, you study his mannerisms carefully. Roll a Wisdom (Insight) check.\n\n*Player rolls a 14*\n\nWith a 14, you notice a few telling signs. The merchant's enthusiasm seems genuine when discussing the craftsmanship of the blade, which is indeed of excellent quality. However, you catch him glancing away momentarily when specifically mentioning its \"magical aura that strikes fear into enemies.\" His knowledge of its magical properties seems rehearsed rather than authentic.\n\nYour instincts tell you the sword is a finely crafted weapon but likely has no magical properties. The merchant isn't outright lying—he may even believe some of the tales himself—but is certainly embellishing to justify the premium price."

/**
 * Exploration prompt template
 */
const explorationPromptTemplate: PromptTemplate = {
  systemPrompt: `
${basePromptTemplate.systemPrompt}

You are guiding players through exploration of the world. Focus on:
- Providing rich, sensory descriptions of new locations
- Highlighting interesting elements that invite investigation
- Responding to perception, investigation, and knowledge checks
- Managing travel pace, navigation, and environmental challenges
- Introducing appropriate random encounters that enhance the story
- Creating a sense of discovery and wonder
- Balancing detail with pacing to maintain engagement

Current location and environment details are provided in the context.

  examples: [

      user: "I want to climb to the top of the tower to get a better view of the surrounding area.",
      assistant: "The ancient stone tower rises at least 60 feet above the forest floor. The exterior has crumbled in places, creating potential handholds, but it looks challenging. This will require an Athletics check. The DC is 15 due to the weathered state of the stones—difficult but not impossible.\n\n*Player rolls a 17*\n\nWith careful movements and good technique, you find a path up the weathered exterior of the tower. Loose stones threaten to give way a few times, but you adjust your weight and continue upward. After several minutes of climbing, you reach the partially collapsed top of the tower.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see for miles. The dense forest stretches to the east and south. To the north, perhaps five miles distant, the trees give way to rolling hills and what appears to be farmland. Most interestingly, to the west, you spot a thin column of smoke rising above the treeline, perhaps two miles away—evidence of a campfire or small settlement. The sun is beginning to lower toward the horizon, giving you perhaps three more hours of daylight."
    },
    {
      user: "I'd like to forage for herbs and medicinal plants while we travel through the forest.",
      assistant: "Foraging while traveling will slow your pace somewhat, but this forest is known for its diverse plant life. Roll a Wisdom (Survival) check to find useful herbs.\n\n*Player rolls a 16*\n\nWith a 16, your trained eye spots several valuable plants among the undergrowth. Over the course of your travel today, you manage to collect:\n\n- A bundle of feverfew, useful for treating headaches and inflammation\n- Several stems of willow bark, which can be brewed into a pain-relieving tea\n- A small cluster of rare bloodroot, prized by healers for its potent medicinal properties\n\nThese ingredients could be used to create basic healing poultices or sold to an herbalist or alchemist in town. The bloodroot in particular might fetch a good price, perhaps 15 gold from the right buyer.\n\nYour foraging extends your travel time by about an hour, and you notice the daylight beginning to fade as you continue through the increasingly dense woods."

/**
 * Puzzle-solving prompt template
 */
const puzzlePromptTemplate: PromptTemplate = {
  systemPrompt: `
${basePromptTemplate.systemPrompt}

You are presenting a puzzle or mystery for the players. Focus on:
- Describing puzzle elements clearly while maintaining some challenge
- Providing appropriate hints based on skill checks and player insights
- Acknowledging creative approaches to solving problems
- Rewarding clever thinking even if it differs from the intended solution
- Balancing puzzle difficulty with game pacing
- Ensuring the puzzle makes logical sense within the game world
- Maintaining consistency in puzzle mechanics and rules

Current puzzle details are provided in the context.

      assistant: "You lean closer to study the intricate runes encircling the stone door. Roll an Intelligence (Arcana) check to see what you can determine.\n\n*Player rolls a 19*\n\nWith your extensive knowledge of arcane symbols (19 is an excellent roll), you recognize elements of ancient protective wards and planar binding magic. The runes appear to be locking something in rather than keeping people out.\n\nYou also notice that the sequence of runes is arranged in four distinct groups, each corresponding to one of the four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. The water runes are glowing faintly blue, while the others remain dormant.\n\nRecalling the four pedestals in the previous chamber, each with small indentations that could hold something, you suspect a connection. The water basin you already activated likely triggered the water runes. Perhaps activating all four elemental pedestals would unlock this door.\n\nYou also notice something subtle—small scratch marks near the bottom of the door, as if something tried to claw its way out long ago."
    },
    {
      user: "I'd like to use my thieves' tools to try and pick the lock on the treasure chest.",
      assistant: "The ornate treasure chest has a sophisticated lock unlike the simple mechanisms you've encountered in town. This will be a challenging task. Make a Dexterity check using your thieves' tools. Because of the complexity, the DC is 17.\n\n*Player rolls a 13*\n\nYou insert your picks and carefully feel out the mechanism. The lock is intricate—multiple tumblers and what feels like a secondary locking system. With a 13, you're able to manipulate some of the components, but after several minutes of careful work, you hear a concerning click followed by a faint hissing sound.\n\nYou've triggered some kind of trap or security measure! The lock seems to have locked itself more thoroughly, and you catch a whiff of something acrid—possibly poison gas beginning to seep from tiny holes around the lock. You quickly back away before inhaling too much.\n\nIt seems this chest has anti-tampering measures. You might need to find the actual key, discover another way to open it, or attempt again with a different approach. Perhaps a thorough search of the room might reveal clues about disarming the trap first."

The walls are covered with dried herbs and small trinkets—charms of protection, you guess.\n\n\"So you've agreed to help find our missing little ones,\" she says, gesturing for you to sit. \"The gods answer our prayers at last.\"\n\nShe explains that three children vanished over the past month, always at night, always without a sound. No signs of struggle. The most recent disappearance was just two nights ago—young Finn, the blacksmith's son.\n\n\"There are three places you might want to investigate,\" she tells you, her voice growing hushed. \"The old ruins to the north where strange lights have been seen. The western woods where hunters have heard unfamiliar sounds. And the caves beneath the eastern hills—we've always forbidden our children from playing there.\"\n\nShe pauses, reaching for a small wooden box. \"I cannot offer much coin, but take this. It might aid you.\" Inside is an antique silver pendant in the shape of a shield. \"It has protected my family for generations. May it serve you well.\"\n\nThe quest has been updated in your journal with the three potential investigation locations. The elder has provided a valuable clue about the timing of the disappearances and a useful talisman that seems important to her."

Word of your approach spreads quickly, and by the time you reach the town gates, a crowd has gathered to welcome their returned friends and family. Emotional reunions unfold around you—tears, embraces, and exclamations of gratitude.\n\nMayor Thorne pushes through the crowd, his usually stern face softened with relief. \"You've done it! By the gods, you've actually brought them back!\" He clasps your hand firmly. \"Riverton stands in your debt.\"\n\nOnce the initial celebration calms, the mayor invites you to the town hall. There, away from the commotion, he fulfills his promise of reward: a heavy pouch containing 200 gold pieces and a deed to a small plot of land just outside town.\n\n\"The council has unanimously voted to name you honorary citizens of Riverton,\" he adds. \"Should you ever need shelter or supplies, our doors will be open to you.\"\n\nQuest completed: \"The Missing Villagers\"\nRewards received:\n- 200 gold pieces\n- Deed to land near Riverton\n- Honorary citizenship status (+2 to Charisma checks with Riverton residents)\n- Reputation increased in the region\n\nAs news of your heroism spreads, you notice a travel-worn messenger enter the town hall, bearing what appears to be an urgent letter sealed with an unfamiliar crest..."

/**

- Managing appropriate recovery of resources (hit points, spell slots, etc.)
- Allowing players to reflect on past events and plan future actions

After a simple but satisfying meal of foraged berries and the rabbit Thorne managed to catch, the party settles around the crackling campfire, its warm light creating a bubble of comfort against the dark forest beyond.\n\nThe conversation turns to tales of your pasts as the stars emerge overhead. Each story reveals a little more about your companions—Valira's childhood training with the elven rangers, Thorne's first disastrous attempt at picking a noble's pocket, and Myrden's accidental discovery of his magical talents when he sneezed and temporarily turned his tutor blue.\n\nThere's laughter, thoughtful silences, and a deepening of the bonds between you all. During the night, you each take turns keeping watch. Despite a brief disturbance when a curious fox investigated your campsite, the night passes peacefully.\n\nWith the dawn comes the refreshed feeling of a full long rest. All hit points are restored, and spellcasters regain their expended spell slots. Any exhaustion levels are reduced by one.\n\nAs you prepare to break camp, Valira points out fresh tracks crossing your path about thirty yards away—it seems a group of humanoids passed nearby during the night without noticing your campsite. They appear to be heading toward the mountains."

The innkeeper raises an eyebrow but says nothing when you place a few extra silver pieces on the counter.\n\nCrafting a healing potion typically requires 50 gp worth of materials and 2 days of work. With the bloodroot and other herbs you've gathered, you've offset about 25 gp of that cost. You'll need to spend 25 gp more on additional ingredients from the local apothecary.\n\nRoll an Intelligence check using your proficiency with alchemist's supplies to see how your crafting progresses.\n\n*Player rolls a 16*\n\nWith careful precision, you prepare the ingredients—crushing, mixing, and heating them according to the formula you've studied. The mixture bubbles gently, gradually turning from murky green to a vibrant crimson that glows faintly in the dim tavern light.\n\nAfter two days of work, you successfully produce a standard Potion of Healing (2d4+2 hit points when consumed). The pleasant aroma of your alchemical work has also attracted some attention—a gray-bearded dwarf has been watching your process with interest from across the tavern. On your final day, he approaches and introduces himself as Durgan, a traveling merchant specializing in magical curiosities. He mentions he might be interested in purchasing similar potions should you craft more in the future."
