# Magic System Implementation

## Overview
This directory contains the implementation of the D&D 5e magic system for the AI DM project. The system handles spell data models, casting mechanics, targeting, saving throws, and status effects.

## Components

### Completed Components

#### Spell Data Model (`spell.ts`)
- Core data structures for spells
- Enums for schools, damage types, and conditions
- Interfaces for spell properties (components, casting time, range, duration)

#### Spell Library (`spell-library.ts`)
- Registry for all available spells
- Methods for retrieving spells by name, level, class, etc.
- Spell data validation

#### Spellcasting (`spellcasting.ts`)
- Spell slot management
- Spell preparation and known spells
- Casting mechanics including level scaling

#### Saving Throws (`saving-throws.ts`)
- Saving throw resolution
- Advantage/disadvantage handling
- Racial and class bonuses

#### Targeting (`targeting.ts`)
- Position and distance calculations
- Area-of-effect targeting (sphere, cone, cube, line, cylinder)
- Target validation and scene analysis

#### Status Effects (`status-effects.ts`)
- Application and removal of conditions
- Duration tracking and expiration
- Saving throw opportunities
- Concentration mechanics
- Effect stacking rules

### In-Progress Components

#### Combat Integration
- Integrating spell effects with the combat system
- Initiative modifications from spell effects
- Reaction handling

### Planned Components

#### Class-Specific Features
- Wizard spell book mechanics
- Sorcerer metamagic
- Cleric domain spells
- Warlock invocations

#### Ritual Casting
- Time and resource handling for rituals
- Narrative elements for ritual casting

#### AI-Enhanced Descriptions
- Context-aware spell descriptions
- Environmental interactions
- Descriptive success/failure narratives

## Usage Examples

The `examples` directory contains demonstration scripts showing how to use various components of the magic system:

- `saving-throws-example.ts`: Demonstrates saving throw mechanics
- `status-effects-example.ts`: Shows application and management of status effects

## Next Steps

1. Complete the combat integration
   - Implement initiative modifications
   - Add reaction handling for counterspell, etc.

2. Implement class-specific spell features
   - Start with Wizard spell book management
   - Add Sorcerer metamagic options

3. Add ritual casting mechanics
   - Implement time tracking
   - Add material component handling

4. Expand the spell database
   - Add more spells with full mechanics
   - Ensure proper scaling at higher levels

## Testing

Each component has corresponding tests in the `tests` directory. Run tests with:

```
npm test
```
